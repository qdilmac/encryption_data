# Introduction to Encryption

## Aim of this repo
- This little project aims to teach me bare minimum of encryptions, logic behind them and for me to be able to write simple web server based encryption-decryption system.
- More complex methods, my different encryption ideas can/will be implemented in my future projects. So this will act as a introduction.

## Future Plans??
- I want to create safer data transfer systems for my robotics projects. This little prototypes will help me understand the basics.
- Additionally I'll be able to test the efficiency of different encryption methods. -> This one is especially important in wireless data transfer setups.
